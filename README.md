# SciLinkLLM
A framework aimed at bridging experimental observations with computational materials modeling and literature analysis using large language models. For now it is limited to microscopy images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)
- OpenCV and Pillow for image processing
- Transformers (https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) and model files (https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-12b-it)

## How to use

### For Experiment to Claims Workflow:

1. Run ```example_local.ipynb```
