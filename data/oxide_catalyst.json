    "synthesis_details": "The nominal compositions (molar ratio) of the Mo–V–Te–Ta oxide catalyst are Mo/V/Te/Ta = 1:0.3:0.17:0.12. To make specimen for electron microscopy, the catalyst sample was embedded in a resin, and sectioned by microtome as approximately 50 nm slices. These specimens were introduced into a holey carbon coated Cu grid.",
