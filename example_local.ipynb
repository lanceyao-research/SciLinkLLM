      "The provided High-Angle Annular Dark-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image reveals a complex microstructure within the Mo-V-Te-Ta oxide material. The HAADF-STEM technique provides Z-contrast, meaning heavier elements appear brighter. The image shows a generally amorphous or poorly crystalline region, with some areas exhibiting more ordered structures. The NMF analysis reveals three dominant spatial frequency patterns. NMF Component 1 shows a broad, low-frequency pattern with a corresponding abundance map indicating a relatively uniform distribution across the image, suggesting a background feature or a weakly modulated structure. NMF Component 2 exhibits a higher frequency pattern with a distinct four-fold symmetry in the frequency space, and its abundance map shows a localized region of higher intensity. This suggests a region with a more ordered structure, potentially related to a crystalline phase or a specific arrangement of atoms. NMF Component 3 shows a complex frequency pattern with multiple peaks and its abundance map shows a more dispersed distribution, possibly indicating a more heterogeneous or disordered region. The presence of multiple components suggests a complex interplay of different phases or structural arrangements within the material. Given the material composition (Mo-V-Te-Ta oxide), the observed patterns could be related to the formation of different oxide phases, the presence of defects, or the segregation of different elements. The four-fold symmetry in NMF Component 2 is particularly interesting and warrants further investigation to determine its origin.\n",
