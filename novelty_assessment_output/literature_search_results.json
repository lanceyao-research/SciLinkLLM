Banko\u2019s work details an LR\u2010NMF framework that decomposes XRD data into representative components (phases and textures) and then uses linear regression to predict the weight vector of these components as a function of processing parameters, effectively correlating these NMF components with microstructural features (bankoUnknownyearcombinatorialmethodsand pages 81-86). This approach not only extracts interpretable phase or texture signatures from diffraction patterns but also maps their abundance over a defined parameter space, thereby providing a predictive relationship between these NMF components and measurable microstructural traits (bankoUnknownyearcombinatorialmethodsand pages 86-91).\n\nMoreover, additional descriptions in Banko\u2019s later sections further clarify that while the LR-NMF model does segment the diffraction data into components, its application is primarily effective for simpler systems where phase mixtures are less complex, implying that it establishes a direct, though context-specific, link between the NMF-derived signatures and the overall microstructure observed in polycrystalline films (bankoUnknownyearcombinatorialmethodsand pages 91-95). In parallel, Chauniyal and colleagues have developed a constrained NMF (cNMF) method applied to EBSD data that leverages prior knowledge of known electron backscatter patterns. Their approach directly associates the decomposed component weights with physical microstructural features such as grain boundaries and subtle orientation misalignments, yielding segmentation maps that predict the spatial distribution and overlap of these features (chauniyal2024employingconstrainednonnegative pages 1-3).\n\nChauniyal et al. extend this idea by demonstrating that the weight maps resulting from cNMF provide near pixel-level resolution of grain boundaries, thus offering a quantitative model that links specific EBSD-derived NMF components with the microstructure at very fine scales (chauniyal2024employingconstrainednonnegative pages 15-19). Additional evidence from their work shows that by constraining the factorization with known reference patterns, the method achieves enhanced interpretability, ensuring that each component correlates with distinct crystallographic orientations or phases within the material (chauniyal2024employingconstrainednonnegative pages 5-8).\n\nThese studies demonstrate that models have indeed been developed which utilize NMF techniques\u2014not only in their canonical form but also in a constrained variant\u2014to predict relationships between decomposed data components and quantitative aspects of the microstructure in polycrystalline materials. While the primary focus in Banko\u2019s work is on establishing a predictive map linking phase abundances extracted from XRD data to overall material structure, Chauniyal\u2019s work validates the approach for high-resolution segmentation of microstructural domains via EBSD (bankoUnknownyearcombinatorialmethodsand pages 81-86, chauniyal2024employingconstrainednonnegative pages 1-3).\n\nThus, based on the reviewed literature, models connecting the quantitative outputs of NMF (and its constrained variant) to the overall microstructure have been developed, particularly in the context of processing-structure mapping in thin films and microstructure segmentation in EBSD data (bankoUnknownyearcombinatorialmethodsand pages 86-91, chauniyal2024employingconstrainednonnegative pages 15-19).\n\nReferences\n\n1.
