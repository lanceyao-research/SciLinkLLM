2025-06-04 10:50:38,615 - INFO - Attempting to get FFT/NMF parameters from LLM...
2025-06-04 10:50:43,794 - INFO - LLM successfully suggested parameters: window_size=64, n_components=3
2025-06-04 10:50:43,794 - INFO - LLM Explanation for FFT/NMF params: The image shows a complex interference pattern with varying orientations and intensities, likely arising from thin film interference. A window size of 64 allows capturing several repetitions of the fringes while remaining computationally manageable. Three components are suggested to represent the background, the dominant interference pattern, and potentially a secondary pattern or noise component related to variations in film thickness or surface roughness.
